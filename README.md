# TORPPA90
Substitution matrix based on SeqPredNN (https://github.com/falategan/SeqPredNN)

TORPPA90 is a substitution matrix applicable for use in BLASTP searches. Values in TORPPA90, should be transposed into the table files of substitution matrices BLAST+ source code in order to be used.

This substitution matrix is asymmetrical and reflects inequality of forward and reverse substitutions with respect to the maintenance of local 3D structures within protein sequences.
